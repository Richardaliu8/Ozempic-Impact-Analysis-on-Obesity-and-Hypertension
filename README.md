# Ozempic-Impact-Analysis-on-Obesity-and-Hypertension
Project Overview  
This project focuses on evaluating the treatment effects of Ozempic, a medication commonly used to manage obesity and hypertension. Using a combination of medical claims and prescription data, the analysis delves into causal relationships and treatment efficacy for patients aged 40-75.  

Features  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive analysis of the structure, missing values, and key statistics of the datasets. Visualizations are used to explore the distribution of variables and their interrelationships.  
Data Preprocessing and Merging: The datasets are meticulously prepared for analysis by handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and merging the medical and prescription records to form a cohesive dataset.  
Causal Analysis Setup: Discussion of endogeneity issues within the data and the implementation of strategies to accurately estimate the treatment effects of Ozempic on the study population.  
Model Development with Double-Lasso Technique: Application of the Double-Lasso method to estimate the impact of Ozempic, addressing the endogeneity of treatment assignments to ensure reliable and unbiased results.  
Model Evaluation and Interpretation: The model's performance is assessed, and the treatment effects are interpreted to provide insights into how Ozempic influences health outcomes in obese and hypertensive patients.  
Integration of Additional Insights: The analysis is enriched with demographic factors and additional Ozempic information, examining how different variables influence treatment effects and revealing patterns related to the medication's usage.  
  
Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of Ozempic's effectiveness on a specific patient group, utilizing advanced statistical techniques to uncover causal relationships and treatment impacts. The insights gained aim to inform healthcare providers and policymakers regarding effective strategies for managing obesity and hypertension.
